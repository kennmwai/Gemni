LLM Feedback Module
=====================

Overview
--------

The LLM Feedback Module is a powerful tool for providing real-time feedback to students on their assignments and assessments. Leveraging the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM), this module offers a suite of AI-driven features to support educators in evaluating student work and providing constructive feedback.

Features
--------

* **Real-time Feedback**: Generate instant feedback on student submissions using our LLM technology.
* **Inference Capabilities**: Evaluate models for text, images, and more using our AI/ML API integration.
* **Broad Model Selection**: Access a diverse range of models for various AI tasks, including text completion, image inference, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech.

Getting Started
---------------

### Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/kennmwai/Gemini/llm-feedback-module.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure API keys: Update `config.py` with your AI/ML API credentials. Set up environment variables:

```bash
export API_KEY="your_actual_api_key"
```

### Usage

#### Text Inference

```python
from models.text_completion import TextCompletion

text_completion = TextCompletion()
prompt = "Explain why the sky is blue."
response = text_completion.generate_response(prompt)
print(f"Generated Response: {response}")
```

#### Image Inference

```python
from models.image_inference import ImageInference

image_inference = ImageInference()
prompt = "A futuristic cityscape at sunset."
output_path = image_inference.generate_image(prompt)
print(f"Image saved at: {output_path}")
```

#### Speech to Text

```python
from models.speech_to_text import SpeechToText

speech_to_text = SpeechToText()
audio_url = "https://audio-samples.github.io/samples/mp3/blizzard_unconditional/sample-0.mp3"
text = speech_to_text.convert_audio_to_text(audio_url)
print(f"Converted Text: {text}")
```

#### Text to Speech

```python
from models.text_to_speech import TextToSpeech

text_to_speech = TextToSpeech()
text = "Hello, this is a test of the text to speech conversion."
output_path = text_to_speech.convert_text_to_audio(text)
print(f"Audio saved at: {output_path}")
```
